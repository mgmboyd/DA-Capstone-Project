# DA-Capstone-Project

The capstone project involves an analysis of the students choosing relating to their field of interest or current industry, creating a visualization (static or interactive) using
relevant data and presentation to their classmates. You may use any dataset you can find, if the data is publicly available, or you have permission from the data’s owner to
work with it and share it. Datasets can also be selected from the sample project list. A short 2-3 paragraph proposal on why this dataset is relevant to your industry is required.

You may work with a team of up to 3-4 people, or individually. Each team member is responsible for understanding and being able to explain all portions of the project.
You should expect to share your work with classmates, your instructor, as well as your employer.

Your project should include the following guidelines:<br>
-  Describe your motivation for performing this analysis<br>
-  Describe your data sources<br>
-  Project includes multiple data transformation (example: converting columns to different data type)<br>
-  Project includes at least one statistical analysis and one graphic that supports your data.<br>
-  One graph that supports your conclusions.<br>
-  Each section of your project should be accompanied by an explanation. For example, a 1-2 paragraph explaining what is happening in that section or graph – so the reader understandings the story being told.<br>
-  Presentation 10-15 minutes.<br>
-  Presentation: did the audience come away with a clear understanding of why you undertook this project?<br>
-  Presentation: did the audience come away with a clear understanding of one insight or conclusion you’ve found?<br>
-  Delivered code and data should run without errors.<br>
-  Code should be hosted on github.<br>
